July 19th, 2022

So, where to begin? I found you on Tech Ladies and I'm on the search for a place where I can thrive. I love programming front to back and I am at the point in my career where I want to grow, fast.

I am/I : 
- Passionate about communication
- Creative
- Love working with APIs
- Effective on my own and can pull my weight on a small team

My current work is in .NET Core on a team with one Senior Dev, myself and two Mobile Apps Devs. I support all of our internal software (sales, advertising, reporting, CMS) design the front and back of 500+ client websites in MVC, Bootstrap, React etc. and write API calls and supporting backend code for our mobile apps. When I joined the team we were in desperate need of some docs/support so I write documentation, I meet with Product Managers to design, plan and implement, and I have also closed over 200 support tickets already this year.
